## While Loop 

### Basic Syntax ðŸ”£
```
#!/bin/bash
while[condition]
do
  command 1

done
```

### WHILE VS UNTIL LOOP ðŸ¤”

- **While Loop** executes the block of code (enclosed in do...done) **when the condition is true** and **keeps executing that till the condition becomes false.** Once the condition becomes false, the while loop is terminated.

- **Until Loop** executes the block of code (enclosed in do...done) **when the condition is false** and **keep executing that till the condition becomes true.** Once the condition becomes true, the until loop is terminated.
